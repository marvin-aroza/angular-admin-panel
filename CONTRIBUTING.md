## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 22 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone the repository directly to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marvin-aroza/angular-admin-panel.git
cd angular-admin-panel
```

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Environment Configuration**

Currently, this project doesn't require specific environment variables. If any are needed in the future, they will be documented here.

3. **Running the Development Server**

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Angular development server at `http://localhost:4200`. The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.

4. **Running Tests**

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in CI mode (for continuous integration)
npm run test:ci
```

5. **Building the Project**

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Build and watch for changes
npm run watch
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style and Best Practices

#### Angular Conventions
- Follow the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper component lifecycle management
- Use reactive programming patterns with RxJS

#### Code Formatting
- The project uses Prettier for code formatting
- Configuration is included in `package.json`
- Code will be automatically formatted on commit using Husky hooks

#### Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for all new components and services
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use Angular Testing Utilities and Jasmine/Karma
- Test files should be named `*.spec.ts`

#### Documentation
- Document all public APIs using JSDoc comments
- Update README.md if you add new features
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Update this CONTRIBUTING.md if you change the development process

### Branch Naming Convention

Create branches using the following format:

```
<type>/<ticket-number>-<brief-description>
```

**Examples:**
- `feat/aap123-user-authentication`
- `fix/aap456-dashboard-loading-issue`
- `docs/aap789-update-readme`

**Types:**
- `feat` - New features
- `fix` - Bug fixes
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

## Submitting Changes

### Commit Message Format

Follow the conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Structure:**
- **type**: The type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- **scope**: The ticket number (e.g., AAP123)
- **description**: A brief description of the change

**Examples:**
```
feat(AAP123): add user authentication module

fix(AAP456): resolve dashboard loading spinner issue

docs(AAP789): update installation instructions in README

style(AAP101): format components according to prettier rules

refactor(AAP202): optimize data fetching in user service

test(AAP303): add unit tests for login component
```

git pull origin develop
```

2. **Create and switch to your feature branch**:
```bash
